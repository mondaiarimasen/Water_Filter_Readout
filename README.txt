I. Motivation

  - want to get the flow rate of the cooling water for the He compressor,
    which is located outside the building, without having to go outside
    
  - send an alert (via email probably) if the flow rate is below the lower
    acceptable threshold value

*****************************************************************************
II. Program Descriptions

  - labjack_readout.py
        ->  first program to get data from LJ and store it; LJ is connected
            to function generator, for testing the readout programs

  - labjack_realtime_plotting.py
        ->  gets data from LJ and plots in real time, with autoscaling of
            y-axis (so like an oscilloscope); fixed x-axis length, so as more
            data is read, the plot moves, so we call this the 'shifting'
            graph;

  - plotter_labjack_readout.py
        ->  plots data written in testSignalGenData.dat

  - testSignalGenData.dat
        ->  generated by labjack_readout.py and contains the data from LJ

*****************************************************************************
III. Comments

  - labjack_realtime_plotting.py will eventually write to
    testSignalGenData.dat
  - The LJ may be offsetting the signal by it's noise, so still investigating
